# Twitter-ASCII-Bot 
<a href="https://twitter.com/AsciiDailyArt">@AsciiDailyArt<a/>

## A fully functional Twitter Bot that takes a random artwork from the Artic API and tweets it in the ASCII art form.

This is a personal project to help me understand APIs requests and image processing. Artic API (https://github.com/art-institute-of-chicago/artic.edu) and Twitter API (https://github.com/twitterdev) was used to do the following:

* Pick a random artwork from the Artic API.
* Process the image of the artwork into a ASCII styled version.
* Get information regarding the name of the artwork, artist's name, date created, medium used to create and dimensions.
* Post the tweet and the info with the Twitter API.

## Find a bug ? Performance improvements ?

Since this is just a personal project to help me learn, I encourage you to submit pull requests, issues, anything that makes this bot work better!
